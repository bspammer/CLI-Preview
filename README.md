# CLI-Preview
Preview images on the command line

A tool I created when I got annoyed at having to transfer images from a remote
location accessed via `ssh`, just to see what "untitled.png" contained.

Supports ASCII-art style previewing or full color if your terminal supports
TrueColor.

Relies on the Python Imaging Library (specifically the [pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) fork.)
